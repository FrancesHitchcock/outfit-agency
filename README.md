# OUtfit Agency MERN Full-Stack Project

## Why I am undertaking the project

I am undertaking this project to consolidate learning from the Tech Educators MERN full-stack bootcamp June to August 2023.

Specifically the project should ensure the Database data is re-rendered immediately following any change, and should contain a working filter function that filters current data. These should be achieved by storing all relevant state - and its associated functionality - in the common ancestor Rect component.

A Trello board is being used for project management.

## About the Website

The website is for a fictional company where people can lease out their outfits for special occasions and other people can hire them for a fee. The site has the facility for an agency administrator to update or delete database objects.

The focus of the project is on functionality, not UX/UI design, so the CSS is basic.

There will be no fee or payment facility as part of the website, as the purpose is purely to consolidate the http methods and instant rendering. For the same reason, no dates are involved - once the item is reserved it is totally removed from the database.

## User Stories

- As an outfit agency administrator I want to be able to update outfit details and delete outfits from the database. I want the database and front end to reflect the changes immediately.

- As an outfit owner I want to submit outfit details by means of a form. I want my outfit to appear immediately in the database and front end.

- As an outfit hirer I want to click on an outfit to learn more about it. I then want to click a button to reserve an outfit. I want the outfit to be removed from the database and front end immediately it has been reserved.
